### UP FOR GRABS

Tests
- Use standard tests.

Crypto stuff:
- kFromMessage
- Check all the tweak instructions.

Better handling of corrupt blocks.

Network:
- Firewall-busting PeerConnections. UPnP?
- Crypto on network. TLS?
- Make work with IPv6
- Consider node addresses

CLI client
- Implement CLI option "--help".

General:
- Better logging.
  - Colours.
  - Time/thread/channel stamp.

### GAV

FOR ALPHA:

Network:
* NotInChain will be very bad for new peers - it'll run through until the genesis.
  - Check how many it has first.

UI:
* State panel shouldn't show pending (i.e. post-mined) transactions.


### ERIC

Build:
* Windows build.


LATER:

Trie on DB.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.


### TIM

Stateful Miner class.

Better Mod-Exp.
